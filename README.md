# KOauth - Asynchronous Scala Library for OAuth 1.0a

**Not released yet. Work is in progress. Not ready for any kind of testing or using in production.**

This library aids calculations according to the [Oauth 1.0a](http://oauth.net/core/1.0a/)
specifications for both HTTP server and client.

* Provider library: Verifying and responding to HTTP requests according to OAuth 1.0 specifications.
* Consumer library: Complementing HTTP requests to be sent with OAuth parameters. 

## Set up your project dependencies

If you're using SBT, clone this project, build and publish it to your local repository and
add to your project as a dependency.

Building and publishing locally:

```
git clone https://github.com/kovacshuni/koauth.git
cd koauth
sbt
compile
publish-local
```

I also don't understand yet all these versions of Scala and SBT and numbers concatenated to
artifact names with underscores and the single/double percent stuff, so i just hardcoded 2.11.

Add as dependency by editing your `build.sbt` and adding the following:

```scala
libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  "com.hunorkovacs" % "koauth_2.11" % "1.0"
)
```

Or if you want to be on the bleeding edge using snapshots:

```scala
libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  "com.hunorkovacs" % "koauth_2.11" % "1.0-SNAPSHOT"
)
```

koauth is available on Maven Central. No it's not. Not yet. But i'll try to publish it soon.

```scala
resolvers += "Sonatype Releases" at "https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases/"
```

or 

```scala
resolvers += "Sonatype Releases" at "https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/"
```

## Asynchronous

*Futures* were used everywhere possible in the code, trying to make the every call
independent to run in parallel. You will need to supply an `ExecutionContext` for
the `OauthService` functions:

```scala
import play.api.libs.concurrent.Execution.Implicits.defaultContext
```

## Step By Step Example - Provider

How to integrate OAuth verification in your REST API server, using this library.

There is also an sample project: [koauth-sample-play](https://github.com/kovacshuni/koauth-sample-play)
that you can most easily follow. It is using [Play Framework](http://www.playframework.com/) 2.2.2
as web framework, [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) with [ReactiveMongo](http://reactivemongo.org/)
to save client credentials and other details. Worth to use as the starting point, because it is
easier to understand.

### Define the HTTP paths required by OAuth 1

* POST to /oauth/request-token
* POST to /oauth/authorize
* POST to /oauth/access-token

Your exact paths may differ, but for a proper OAuth 1 you will need to define at least 3 for these above.
You will probably want paths, to register a new user, verify their email, read the rights a token gives
access to, and invalidate tokens but that is not mandatory here, but your app's part to do.

### Mapping your HTTP requests and responses

You will need to **implement the `OauthRequestMapper` and `OauthResponseMapper`** to map your web
framework's HTTP request and response types to the library's independent types.
After that, you can easily call the service methods of the koauth library.
You may also want to catch the exception that may occur during authentication and return your specific
HTTP responses accordingly.

```scala
object PlayToOauthRequestMapper extends OauthRequestMapper[Request[AnyContent]] {
  override def map(source: Request[AnyContent])(implicit ec: ExecutionContext): Future[OauthRequest] = {
    Future {
      OauthRequest(source.headers("Authorization"),
        "http://" + source.host.toLowerCase + "/" + source.path,
        source.method.toUpperCase,
        source.queryString)
    }
  }
}

object OauthToPlayResponseMapper extends OauthResponseMapper[SimpleResult] {
  override def map(source: Future[OauthResponseOk])(implicit ec: ExecutionContext): Future[SimpleResult] = {
    source.map(r => Ok(r.body))
  }
}

object OauthController extends Controller {
  /**
   * Mapped to POST /oauth/request-token
   */
  def requestToken = Action.async { request =>
    try {
      val oauthRequestF = PlayToOauthRequestMapper.map(request)

      val oauthResponseF = OauthService.requestToken(oauthRequestF)

      OauthToPlayResponseMapper.map(oauthResponseF)
    } catch {
      case badRequestEx: OauthBadRequestException => Future(BadRequest(badRequestEx.message))
      case unauthorizedEx: OauthUnauthorizedException => Future(Unauthorized(unauthorizedEx.message))
    }
  }
}
```

### Calling the Oauth services

There are service functions defined in `OauthService` for every necessary step in OAuth 1.
Please read [the documentation](http://oauth.net/core/1.0a/) of Oauth 1, understand the process
of obtaining an access token and using one for authenticating requests. Implement your controllers
for the specification's steps and use the service's methods.

### Persistence

Another **must is to provide an implementation for the `OauthPersistence` trait*** and relate to
the object in your controller class implicitly (or pass to service methods explicitly).

```scala
implicit val persistenceService: OauthPersistence = new InMemoryOauthPersistence()
```

There is one implementation provided by the koauth library itself, as a guideline 
but it is *in-memory*, and all the kept data is lost after stopping the application.

## Step By Step Example - Consumer

How to build HTTP requests that should be OAuth signed, using this library.

todo write this readme part

## Fully, absolutely RESTful

At the step where the *request token* is exchanged to an *access token*, there is a part where
the user logs in to the service provider (if not logged in yet), reads the rights that the token
will have permission to use and authorizes the *request token*. This will be permitted
to be exchanged to an *access token* with the corresponding rights to use.

This step is called *authorize*.

Now this part is not strictly specified how to be done, but most of the documentations I found
are talking about logging in the service provider website and clicking an, for example,
approve button, then that website redirecting them and so on.

This library was designed to be able to be used **without the need to pass by the REST API**,
without directly communicating with a so-called website, reading rights in HTML or clicking buttons.
So the *authorize* step is done by adding the *username* and *password* as
additional OAuth parameters to the *Authorization* header of the *authorize* HTTP request.
No need for verifying any signature in this step. But authenticating the user by the provided 
username and password. This is
the only call when we are sending the real password to the application server, it represents
the part when the user would type their credentials on a website and hitting the log in button.

Presenting the user with the rights the token is warranted would be another necessity. One should 
define a REST endpoint that presents these rights, but because this does not expose any
specific info about any user, it's close to being static (except the list of rights) I left this
out of the responsabilies of this library.
